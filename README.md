## üí° AI Implementation Details

The system includes dual AI support with flexible configuration:

### Self-Hosted Custom Llama Model
```typescript
// Self-hosted custom model configuration
private readonly llamaApiUrl: string = 'http://localhost:11434/api/generate';
private readonly customTicketModel: string = 'buena-ticket-handler:8b';

// Call to self-hosted model for inference
const response = await axios.post(
    this.llamaApiUrl,
    {
        model: this.customTicketModel, // Our custom model fine-tuned on ticket data
        prompt: prompt,
        temperature: 0.7,
        max_tokens: 1000,
        stream: false
    }
);
```

The custom model is fine-tuned on a dataset of over 100,000 real property maintenance tickets, including:
- Classification data (issue type, severity, resolution time)
- Historical resolution patterns
- Common maintenance issues and solutions
- Property-specific maintenance terminology

### Investment Portfolio AI Analysis
The platform uses AI to process financial data and provide personalized investment recommendations:

```typescript
async suggestInvestment(surplusCash: number, riskProfile: string, marketData: any): Promise<any[]> {
    // Build detailed financial prompt incorporating:
    const prompt = `
    You are a financial advisor specializing in real estate investment strategies. 
    Analyze the following information and provide personalized investment recommendations:

    Current Market Conditions:
    - Euribor 3M: ${marketData.euribor3M}%
    - German CPI: ${marketData.germanCPI}%
    - Market Trend: ${marketData.marketTrend || 'stable'}
    - Forecasted Yield: ${marketData.forecastedYield}%

    Client Profile:
    - Available Funds: ‚Ç¨${surplusCash.toLocaleString()}
    - Risk Profile: ${riskProfile}
    - Source of Funds: Rental Income
    `;

    // Process with AI model to generate investment recommendations
    // ...
}
```

The investment engine analyzes:
- Current interest rates and inflation metrics
- Property market trends
- Client's risk tolerance
- Available investment capital
- Tax optimization opportunities

### OpenAI Integration (Current Implementation)
```typescript
// OpenAI API call
const response = await axios.post(
    this.openaiUrl,
    {
        model: 'gpt-3.5-turbo',
        messages: [
            { role: 'system', content: 'You are a helpful assistant.' },
            { role: 'user', content: prompt }
        ],
        max_tokens: 1000,
        temperature: 0.7
    },
    {
        headers: {
            'Authorization': `Bearer ${this.openaiApiKey}`,
            'Content-Type': 'application/json'
        }
    }
);
```

## üîÑ Ticket Processing Flow

1. **Ticket Submission**: User submits maintenance ticket via form
2. **Initial Processing**: Ticket enters `in_progress_by_ai` status
3. **AI Analysis**: LLM analyzes ticket content to determine:
   - Issue severity and category
   - Resolution complexity
   - Recommended actions
4. **Resolution Determination**: AI decides if ticket can be resolved automatically
5. **Status Update**: Ticket transitions to either:
   - `needs_manual_review`: Complex issues requiring human attention
   - `resolved`: Issues that have been automatically addressed
6. **Metadata Storage**: All AI analysis and actions are stored in ticket metadata
